# Problem 1

## Load the dataset

Load the penguins dataset.

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

## Write a short description of the dataset

The penguins dataset has 8 important variables: species, island,
bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex,
year. There are 3 levels under the variable species. There are 3 levels
under the variable island. The variable year has values of 2007, 2008,
2009. The dataset has 344 rows and 8 columns. The mean flipper length is
200.9152047.

## Make a scatterplot

Make a scatterplot of flipper_length_mm (y) vs bill_length_mm (x).

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point()
```

Export the scatterplot to the project directory.

``` r
ggsave("scatter_plot.pdf")
```
